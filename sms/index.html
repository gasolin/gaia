        <article><h1>Messages: The official messaging application for Firefox OS</h1><p>The Messages application lets users to send SMS (<em>short messages</em>) and MMS (<em>multimedia
messages</em>) using a phone running Firefox OS.</p>
<h2>How to retrieve the code</h2><p>SMS is part of the Gaia Github repo. To download it you need <code>git</code> installed on
your computer, and you need to run the following command:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-bash"><code>git clone https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia</code></pre><p>The code for Gaia will be downloaded from Github to a local subdirectory <code>gaia</code>.
You can enter the <code>gaia</code> directory by typing:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-bash"><code>cd gaia</code></pre><h2>How to run the application in Firefox</h2><ul>
<li><p>Install an up-to-date <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org/">Firefox Nightly</a> on your
computer. Bear in mind that Nightly can sometimes be broken; if you experience
problems try using <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/channel/#aurora">Firefox Aurora</a>
instead (this may also not work as we rely on very recent functionality that is
sometimes only available in Nightly.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Generate a Gaia debug profile and use the following commands to run it in
Nightly (this will take some time):</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-bash"><code>export FIREFOX=/path/to/nightly/firefox
PROFILE_FOLDER=profile-sms DEBUG=1 DESKTOP=0 make
$FIREFOX -profile profile-sms --no-remote app://sms.gaiamobile.org</code></pre><ul>
<li>Press <em>CTRL-SHIFT-M</em> (or <em>Cmd-Opt-M</em> on MacOS X) to switch the Responsive Mode.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using the right fonts</h3><ul>
<li><p>You can download the <a href="http://www.carrois.com/fira-3-1/#download">Fira Sans fonts</a>
and install them on your system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, configure your Firefox to use them
(<em>Preferences &gt; Content &gt; Fonts &amp; Colors</em> &gt; change the default font. Also click
the <em>Advanced...</em> button and update the <em>Proportional</em>, <em>Serif</em> and <em>Sans-serif</em>
font preferences).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use Mulet (see below), this should already be done for you.</p>
<h3>What works fine</h3><p>In this mode, you can use the DevTools (<em>CTRL-SHIFT-K</em>, or <em>Cmd-Opt-K</em> on MacOS
X) to debug CSS and JavaScript. You can also install Firebug if you prefer it.</p>
<p>If you modify a file in the application directory, you can simply hit the
<em>reload</em> button to see the changes.</p>
<h3>What doesn't work</h3><ul>
<li>The application uses some mockups for most APIs. That means they won't
remember anything from previous launches.</li>
<li>The application doesn't run inside Firefox OS. That means cross-application
communication (eg: activities) doesn't work. That also means it can't receive
SMS, although we fake this when you try to send a message.</li>
<li>We don't simulate Dual SIM in this mode.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What if the application doesn't load correctly?</h3><p>You should try to delete your profile directory and regenerate it. If it still
doesn't work, please <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox%20OS&amp;component=Gaia%3A%3ASMS&amp;short_desc=[Messages]%20Running%20the%20application%20in%20Firefox%20is%20broken">file a bug</a>
with as much information as you can.</p>
<h3>What if I want to simulate more things?</h3><p>Early work has started on a Simulator that should make it possible to control
the API in a better way. Currently it works fine for Dual SIM
support, which makes it easier to debug CSS or JavaScript in this mode.</p>
<p>You can cherry-pick the branch from <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1069338">Bug 1069338</a>,
and then load up <em>app://sms.gaiamobile.org/simulator/</em>.</p>
<h2>How to run the application in Mulet</h2><p>Mulet is a specialized browser build that allows us to run Gaia in an environment
closer to a real Firefox OS device, while still having access to Firefox's
developer tools. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developing_Gaia/Different_ways_to_run_Gaia#Using_Gaia_in_Firefox_Mulet">You can find more information on
MDN</a>.</p>
<h2>How to contribute to the development</h2><h3>Filing a good bug</h3><p>Filing a bug with the right information is already a very good first step
towards fixing a bug.</p>
<p>Here are the important details to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which device and Firefox OS version are you using? You'll get bonus points if
you can precisely state the Build Date, Gaia commit hash, and Gecko commit hash.</li>
<li>Describe precise steps you can follow to make the bug happen.</li>
<li>Does the bug happen every time? Otherwise, please include an estimate of how
often the bug happens (e.g. 5 times in 10.)</li>
<li>Provide a screenshot and even a video, if you can. To take a screenshot on a
Firefox OS device, you can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/WebIDE">WebIDE</a>
or longpress <em>Power+Volume Down</em> (note: older
versions used <em>Power+Home</em>). <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Debugging/taking_screenshots">There's more than one way to do
it, see MDN</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have this information, you can <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox%20OS&amp;component=Gaia%3A%3ASMS">file the bug on
Bugzilla</a>
and we should handle it in a few days (most of the time before 1 day).</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developing_Firefox_OS/Filing_bugs_against_Firefox_OS">more information about filing bugs on
MDN</a>.</p>
<h3>Finding a bug to fix</h3><p>We maintain a list of non-urgent bugs that a contributor can take on. Usually we
try to add bugs in this list only if it can be fixed in Firefox using the
previous steps. We can have more involved bugs though, if you want more of a challenge. You can <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?f1=bug_mentor&amp;o1=isnotempty&amp;resolution=---&amp;emailtype1=exact&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;emailassigned_to1=1&amp;email1=nobody%40mozilla.org&amp;component=Gaia%3A%3ASMS&amp;product=Firefox%20OS">consult the
bug list here</a>,
and we also have a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?o1=isnotempty&amp;emailtype1=exact&amp;status_whiteboard_type=substring&amp;emailassigned_to1=1&amp;status_whiteboard=[good%20first%20bug]&amp;email1=nobody%40mozilla.org&amp;f1=bug_mentor&amp;resolution=---&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;component=Gaia%3A%3ASMS&amp;product=Firefox%20OS">list of easier bugs that new contributors can fix</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of these bugs is more about setting up the environment and getting used
to the development process.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/?b2g=1&amp;unowned=1">find bugs in other applications using Bugs Ahoy</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also try to fix bugs that are not included in these lists, if
you find something more interesting.</p>
<p>Once you have found a bug you want to work on, please ask kindly on the bug if
you can work on the issue. The owner/mentor should respond soon enough.</p>
<h3>Fixing the bug and proposing a patch</h3><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developing_Gaia">A lot of useful information can be found on MDN already</a>
so we won't repeat it here. Be careful as MDN explains how to run the full Gaia
app suite in Firefox, whereas here we are interested in working on the Messages
app specifically.</p>
<p>You can also find some information about the Messages app development process
<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gaia/SMS">on the Wiki page for the Messages app</a>,
including links to the always evolving code style guidelines.</p>
<p>If you want more help you can discuss the Messages app on <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC">IRC</a>:
see the <em>#gaia</em>
and <em>#gaia-messaging</em> channels on the <em>irc.mozilla.org</em> IRC server.</p>
<h3>Running unit tests</h3><p>You can find <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Platform/Automated_testing/Gaia_unit_tests">very detailed instructions on MDN</a>
concerning running Gaia's unit tests. Please refer to those instructions if you have issues.</p>
<p>Here are some basic instructions, assuming your Firefox Nightly is installed in
<code>~/firefox-nightly/</code>. Please adjust the instructions to your own environment.</p>
<p>These lines will run what we call the test server: both Firefox and the
background server, that are needed to run the tests:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-bash"><code>export FIREFOX=~/firefox-nightly/firefox
bin/gaia-test</code></pre><p>The background server runs a watcher that automatically runs tests when the
files are saved. To run a specific file you can simply open it in an editor
and save it, or use the command line tool <code>touch</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to run all tests for the SMS app, you can run the following in a separate
terminal:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-bash"><code>APP=sms make test-agent-test</code></pre></article>
